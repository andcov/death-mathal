# Death Mathal

This is a website where I create tools that help me teach math. More often than not, kids aren't afraid of math due to a lack of talent or intelligence, but due to a lack of exposure. As such, it can sometimes be helpful to simply churn through a bunch of simple exercises in order to create a solid base, and a computer can create millions of these exercises. I have also found that the kids that benefit from these exercises often perceive math as something terrible, akin to death, hence the name.
