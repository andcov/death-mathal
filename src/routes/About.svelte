<p>...is a place where I create tools that help me teach math.</p>

<p>More often than not, kids aren't afraid of math due to a lack of talent or intelligence, but due to a lack of exposure.
As such, it can sometimes be helpful to simply churn through a bunch of simple exercises in order to create a solid base, 
and a computer can create millions of these exercises.</p>


<p>Coincidentally, I have also found that the kids that require these exercises often perceive math as something terrible, akin to death, hence the name.</p>
